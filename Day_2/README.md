Hello Oscar,

🎒 Today’s Assignments

Complete Unit 2: “Embeddings and Vector Stores/ Databases”:

    Listen to the summary podcast episode for this unit.
    To complement the podcast, read the “Embeddings and Vector Stores/ Databases” whitepaper.
    Complete these codelabs on Kaggle:
        Build a RAG question-answering system over custom documents.
        Explore text similarity with embeddings.
        Build a neural classification network with Keras using embeddings.
    Want to have an interactive conversation? Try adding the whitepaper to NotebookLM. 

💡 What You’ll Learn

Today you will learn about the conceptual underpinning of embeddings and vector databases, and how they can be used to bring live or specialist data into your LLM application. You’ll also explore their geometrical powers for classifying and comparing textual data as well as how to evaluate embeddings.
