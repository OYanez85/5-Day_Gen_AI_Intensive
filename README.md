🎒 # 5-Day_Gen_AI_Intensive
Google's 5 days Generative Intensive AI with Kaggle.

Welcome to today's assignments! Follow the steps below to complete your coursework and explore the exciting world of large language models and prompt engineering.

Assignments
1. Complete the Intro Unit – “Foundational Large Language Models & Text Generation”: https://github.com/OYanez85/5-Day_Gen_AI_Intensive/blob/main/whitepaper_Foundational%20Large%20Language%20models%20%26%20text%20generation_v2.pdf

    Podcast: Listen to the summary podcast episode for this unit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na3O4Pkbp-U&list=PLqFaTIg4myu_yKJpvF8WE2JfaG5kGuvoE&index=2

    Whitepaper: Read the “Foundational Large Language Models & Text Generation” whitepaper.

2. Complete Unit 1 – “Prompt Engineering”

    Podcast: Listen to the summary podcast episode for this unit: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFtX0ZyLSAY&list=PLqFaTIg4myu_yKJpvF8WE2JfaG5kGuvoE&index=3)

    Whitepaper: Read the “Prompt Engineering” whitepaper.

    Codelabs on Kaggle:

   - Prompting Fundamentals

   - Evaluation and Structured Data

    Note: Make sure to phone verify your Kaggle account before starting, as it is necessary for the codelabs.

    Extra Tip: Try adding the whitepapers to NotebookLM for an interactive conversation.

💡 What You’ll Learn

Today you’ll:

- Explore the evolution of LLMs—from transformers to advanced techniques like fine-tuning and inference acceleration.

- Get trained in the art of prompt engineering for optimal LLM interaction and evaluation.

- In the first codelab, get started with the Gemini 2.0 API and learn how different prompt parameters impact the responses.

- In the second codelab, learn how to evaluate the responses of LLMs using autoraters and structured output.

📋 Reminders

- Livestream: Tomorrow at 11:00 AM PT, Paige Bailey is hosting the first livestream on our YouTube channel to discuss the assignments with the course authors and special guests from Google. Tomorrow’s guests include Warren Barkley, Logan Kilpatrick, Kieran Milan, Anant Nawalgaria, Irina Sigler, and Mat Velloso.

- Discord: Visit the #5dgai-question-forum channel on Discord to ask questions. Several Googlers and fellow participants are there to help, and selected questions will be discussed during the livestream. You could also win Kaggle swag if your question is chosen!

- Troubleshooting: Check out our troubleshooting guide for the codelabs if you encounter any issues.

- Community: Please follow Kaggle’s community guidelines to help keep our course community positive and supportive.

Happy learning and see you tomorrow!
